# AWS Infra with Terraform

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a small personal project where Iâ€™m using Terraform to set up some AWS infra for hosting static content. The goal is to make it organized, reusable, and secure across three different environments: `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`. Itâ€™s nothing too fancy but gets the job done!

The setup includes:
- S3 buckets for storing static files.
- CloudFront distributions for fast and secure content delivery.
- IAM roles and policies to ensure secure and least-privilege access to the S3 buckets.

---

## Whatâ€™s in this repo?

Hereâ€™s what you get with this setup:

1. **Three environments**:
    - `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`.
2. **Three S3 buckets per environment**:
    - One bucket for `/auth`.
    - Another for `/info`.
    - And another for `/customers`.
3. **One CloudFront distribution per bucket**:
    - Ensures files are served globally, securely, and with caching.
4. **IAM roles and policies**:
    - Grants secure, least-privilege access for CloudFront to read objects from S3 buckets.
5. **Security features**:
    - All S3 buckets are encrypted with AES-256, private, and versioned.

## How I organized the files

The project is modular and easy to maintain. Each module handles a specific responsibility (S3, CloudFront, IAM). The configuration is flexible and reusable for multiple environments.

```  
terraform-aws-infra/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ s3/           # S3 bucket configuration (encryption, versioning, public access blocking)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ cloudfront/   # CloudFront distribution setup
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ iam/          # IAM roles and policies for secure access
â”œâ”€â”€ envs/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dev/          # Environment-specific configuration for dev
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ staging/      # Environment-specific configuration for staging
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ prod/         # Environment-specific configuration for prod
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf    # Global variables
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf      # Outputs for S3, CloudFront, and IAM
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf     # Backend and provider configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf  
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # This file!
```

### **Modules**

- **S3**:
    - Creates S3 buckets with encryption, versioning, and public access restrictions.
    - Buckets are dynamically named based on the `%60bucket_name%60`, `%60environment%60`, and `%60path%60` variables (e.g., `%60bucket1-dev-auth%60`).
- **CloudFront**:
    - Configures CloudFront distributions to serve content from the S3 buckets.
    - Uses default SSL certificates for HTTPS and sets caching policies for performance.
- **IAM**:
    - Creates IAM roles and policies to allow CloudFront to securely access S3 buckets.
    - Follows the principle of least privilege by granting only `%60s3:GetObject%60` permissions.

---

## Environments

The `envs/` folder contains configurations for each environment. These configurations use the modules to create resources specific to `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`.

Example `tfvars` files for the environments:

### **dev.tfvars**
```hcl  
environment = "dev"  
bucket_name = "bucket1"  
path        = "auth"  
```

### **staging.tfvars**
```hcl  
environment = "staging"  
bucket_name = "bucket1"  
path        = "auth"  
```

### **prod.tfvars**
```hcl  
environment = "prod"  
bucket_name = "bucket1"  
path        = "auth"  
```

## How to run this

Hereâ€™s how to deploy it yourself:

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-aws-infra.git  
   cd terraform-aws-infra  
   ```

2. **Create a bucket for Terraform state**:  
   ```bash  
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket terraform-pet-project-bucket --region eu-central-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-central-1  
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**:  
   ```bash  
   terraform init -backend-config=envs/{env}/{env}-backend.conf --reconfigure

   ```

4. **Set the variables**:  
   Use a `tfvars` file for each environment (e.g., `dev.tfvars`).

5. **Plan and apply the changes**:
    - To preview changes:
      ```bash  
      terraform plan -var-file=./envs/{env}/{env}.tfvars
      ```
    - To apply the changes:
      ```bash  
      terraform apply -var-file=./envs/{env}/{env}.tfvars
      ```

6. **Clean up resources** (when you're done):
    - To destroy everything:
      ```bash  
      terraform destroy -var-file=./envs/{env}/{env}.tfvars
      ```

## Security Features

Hereâ€™s what I did to keep things secure:
1. **S3 Buckets**:
    - All buckets are private by default.
    - AES-256 encryption ensures data is secure at rest.
    - Versioning is enabled to prevent accidental data loss.
    - Public access is completely blocked using `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block`.

2. **IAM Roles and Policies**:
    - Each CloudFront distribution gets a dedicated IAM role.
    - The roles are granted least-privilege `s3:GetObject` permissions for their respective buckets.

3. **CloudFront**:
    - Enforces HTTPS for secure communication.
    - Uses default SSL certificates for encryption in transit.

## Whatâ€™s next?

Here are some ideas to improve this project further:
- **Enable logging**:
    - S3 bucket access logs and CloudFront logs for operational visibility and troubleshooting.
- **Add CI/CD**:
    - Automate deployments with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
    - Protect CloudFront distributions with WAF for enhanced security.
- **Custom SSL Certificates**:
    - Use AWS Certificate Manager to add domain-specific SSL certificates.

---

## Outputs

When you apply the Terraform code, youâ€™ll get:
- **S3 Bucket ARNs**: Useful for troubleshooting and IAM policies.
- **CloudFront Distribution URLs**: The URLs for accessing your static content.
- **IAM Role Names**: For auditing and verification.
